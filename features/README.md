The Cucumber Feaures in this folder currently indicate the beta features for Ao3 Reader. They can be used to run integration tests and verify that changes to the code base don't break any existing features.

Features are currently pulled from the [Dreamwith Devlog](https://momijizukamori.dreamwidth.org/tag/ao3+reader) and the [MobileRead forum](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=346102)

## Running the integation tests
The Cucumber feaures in this folder are not currently connected to any code, and so cannot be run as integration tests
